# E-Commerce-App
> E-commerce website using React.js and Redux Toolkit.

## About The Project
> In this project, I wanted to create an E-Commerce website using `React.js` and `Redux Toolkit`. <br />
The project consists of a home page with all products, a specific detail page for each product <br />
and a shopping cart page where users can add the products they want. <br />
All products on the homepage are fetched from an API. During this time, a loading screen is shown to the user. <br />
You can see the details of the product that you want by clicking on its image and you can add it to the cart. <br />
You can also change the number of products you added or delete the product from the cart. <br />
While you are doing these operations, you will see an information message on the navbar. <br />

> State management is very easy using Redux Toolkit. It allows that using a state on different pages. <br />
The navbar shows the number of products in the cart that we can access on each page.

> Another important point of the project is routing between pages. `React Router` was used for this.

> The website is responsive to all screen sizes.
